# Rest Service Client

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rest-service-client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rest-service-client

## Usage
Add this line to top of your file
```ruby
require 'rest-service-client'
````

Create a class, include the RestServiceClient and configure your service
```ruby
class MyAwesomeService
    include RestServiceClient
  
    # Sets the host url
    # You can use MyAwesomeService.new('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com')
    # to set the host instead. Using host url via constructor has high priority.
    host 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'

    # Sets the default headers for every requests.
    # Will be replaced using: MyAwesomeService.new.find_photo(id: 1, headers: { 'Authorization' => 'Bearer 123456' })
    headers 'Authorization' => 'OAuth 1111|111'

    # Sets the default params for every requests.
    # Will be replaced using: MyAwesomeService.new.find_photo(id: 20)
    params id: 10

    # Configure endpoints:
    # _httpmethod _method_name, _path
    # "get :photos, '/photos'" provides an ability 
    # to make GET request to 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos'
    # using MyAwesomeService.new.photos
    # Supported: get, post, put, patch, delete
    get :photos, '/photos'
    
    # You can assign placeholders for params to path.
    # Example: MyAwesomeService.new.find_photo(id: 1)
    get :find_photo, '/photos/:id'
    
    post :add_photo, '/photos'
    put :update_photo, '/photos/:id'
    patch :update_photo_data, '/photos/:id'
    delete :delete_photo, '/photos/:id'
end
```
